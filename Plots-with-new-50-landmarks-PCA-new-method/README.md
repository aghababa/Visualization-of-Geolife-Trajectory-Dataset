@ Note that you will need to download the dataset

in order to it works.

I have generated new datasets with 50 landmarks to increase the accuracy of results. Als, I have used a new method in my way of doing PCA, so the scatter plot is nice now. 

Trajectory query task is done, but I'm working on a new idea to improve its accuracy. 

Note that all of our data is shown now on the map and it works well.
