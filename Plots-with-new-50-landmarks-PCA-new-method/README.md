@ Note that you will need to download the dataset

in order to it works.

I have generated new datasets with 50 landmarks to increase the accuracy of results. Als, I have used a new method in my way of doing PCA, so the scatter plot is nice now. 

Trajectory query task is done, but I'm working on a new idea to improve its accuracy. 

Note that all of our data is shown now on the map and it works well.

Only main.js and Computation.js are updated. 

Trajectory query task is improved with showing roghly 20 trajectories to the user. 

Centers of clusters are more highlighted.

When you hover on a point in scatter plot, its corresponding trajectory is drown on the map which is nice.
