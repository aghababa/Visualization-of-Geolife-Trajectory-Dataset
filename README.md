# dataviscourse-project-Geolife

This is the repository for our Visualization for Data course. 

In this project we are going to visualize the Geolife GPS Trajectory Dataset released by Microsoft. 

https://msropendata.com/datasets/d19b353b-7483-4db7-a828-b130f6d1f035

The dataset was collected in Microsoft Research Asia Geolife project by 182 users from April 2007 to August 2012. 
A GPS trajectory of this dataset is represented by a sequence of time-stamped points, each of which contains the 
information of latitude, longitude and altitude. 

Team Members: Austin Sheen Watkins and Hasan Pourmahmoodaghababa

We will talk about what we would have done step by step when we finish each phase.
