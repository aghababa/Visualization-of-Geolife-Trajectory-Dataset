# dataviscourse-project-Geolife

This is the repository for our Visualization for Data course. 

In this project we are going to visualize the Geolife GPS Trajectory Dataset released by Microsoft. 

The dataset was collected in Microsoft Research Asia Geolife project by 182 users from April 2007 to August 2012. 
A GPS trajectory of this dataset is represented by a sequence of time-stamped points, each of which contains the 
information of latitude, longitude and altitude. 

Team Members: Austin Sheen Watkins and Hasan Pourmahmoodaghababa

We will talk about what we would have done step by step when we finish each phase.
